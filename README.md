This project was my first *homework* during my programming course by *YouCode*. It was my first homepage. Now I use it as my blog to repeat every lesson I received to be 100% sure about my knowledge.

## **About me** ## 

Hello world!

I am **Katarzyna** and during my career path I was responsible for personal data security and IT help-desk. I have some
experience in replacing computer parts like matrixes, hard drives etc.
I decided to change my path to develop myself as a programmer. I found out after my 30th birthday that is the way I would like to go.

That's it from me for now. If you would like to know more about my experience, please visit
